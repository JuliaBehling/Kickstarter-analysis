# **Kickstarter-Analysis**
## *An Analysis of Kickstarter Data Used to Discover Trends Between Successful Funding Campaigns & Other Variables.* 
_______
## Overview of Project:
#### The purpose of this Analysis was to assist a playwright in raising funds for an aspiring play through a Kickstarter campaign. They were interested in producing the highest likelihood that their play would be fully funded. After adjusting their budget to fit post-analysis trends, the individual was successful in their endeavors.
#### Primary Variables Considered:
* Theater Kickstarter outcomes based on Launch date
* Theater Kickstarter outcomes based on Funding goal.
___
## Analysis and Challenges:
#### The analysis focused on 2 main variables, Theater kickstarter outcomes based on launch date, and Theater Kickstarter outcomes based on funding goal. 
### Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date:

After analyizing data involving Kickstarter launch-dates, there are significantly more successful theater funding campaigns between the months May-June than any other time of the year. The amount of failed campaigns and canceled campaigns do not significantly increase or decrease, leading to the conclusion this is a good time period to launch the Kickstarter. 

### Theater Kickstarter Outcomes based on Funding Goals:

After analyzing data involving Kickstarter funding goals, the highest rate of successfully funded campaigns was within the range of <$1000-$4999. Additional requested funding lead to a decrease in successfully funded campaigns rates and increase in failed campaigns. There is an outlying increase in successful funding rates between the $35000-$44999 range, but the data indicated a dramatic decrease in likelihood post that amount. 

## Notable Challenges:
There were no notable challenges in analyzing this dataset. However, one that may have posed an issue is being mindful of filters attached to the primary excel data sheet. If not cautious, one could have easily left a filter on that would have excluded a large portion of data, directly affecting the accurracy of this analysis.
___
## Results:
### Conclusion Regarding Theater Outcome By Launch Date:
There was a dramatic spike in successful kickstarter campaigns between the months of May-June. One reason may be that is considered theater season, where more people are seeing plays, and are more open to funding new plays. An additional reason may be because it is the beginning of the summer and people are outside, feeling happier, and consequentially more generous. 
### Conclusion Regarding Theater Outcome Based on Goals:
A kickstarter campaign was more likely to be successfully funded when the financial goal resided within a smaller range of money. One reason could be because it feels like a more attainable goal. Financial backers see their money making a difference at a faster rate than the larger funding goals, and are more likely to contribute to something that feels more likely to be met.

### Limitations of Dataset:
This dataset focused predominately on funding as a whole. If you wanted to get really specific it would be good to analyze funding campaigns based on georaphic location. There may be a difference in likelihood of being funded in US versus Great Britain. Additional table for analysis would consider where the individual intends to debut the play, and create a more location-specific analysis based on that information.
